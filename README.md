# WacomGUI
Personal Project where I try to create a graphical Interface to configure a Wacom Tablet. 

This will be made for Ubuntu Mate 17.04 and a Wacom Intuos Art Tablet. I dont know if it works for others, you should just try it (Im not responsible for any damages of any sort). Feel free to add support for others or add functionality.
